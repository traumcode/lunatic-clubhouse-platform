            <p className='vote-text'>We introduced the Lunatic vote to allow Lunatics to choose for their favorite NFT community to compete in Season 1 of the Lunatic Clubhouse.

                The major players for the challenges the Clubhouse devised for season 1 will be the first seven communities that result from the Lunatic Vote.

                The first seven communities will compete in a tournament in which the Leaderboard will be visible at all times. The Championship Trophy will be awarded to the community that earns the most points in the Clubhouse.

                The primary goal for the Lunatics is to accumulate as many points as possible in order to climb the leaderboard. The further up the scoreboard your community is, the better. Certain milestones in the Leaderboard will be awarded with airdrops, prizes, and giveaways.

                The communities competing in Season 1 will be modified. Every month, the last two communities on the Leaderboard will compete with the first two communities who still participate in the Lunatic Vote, in order to maintain their position.</p>
