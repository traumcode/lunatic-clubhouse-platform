                        As the name suggests, this department is in charge of keeping the peace in the Lunatic Clubhouse.
                        It is composed of the Bouncers and the Lunatic Guards. The Bouncers can be found roaming all over
                        the clubhouse, as well as by the entrance. The Lunatic Guards are in shorter supply than the bouncers,
                        as their main duty is to keep the Lunatic Council secure and to make sure that only members can enter.
